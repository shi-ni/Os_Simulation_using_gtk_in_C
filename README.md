## üìå Project Overview

This Operating System Simulator replicates a basic desktop environment using **C** and **GTK** on **Linux**. It allows users to launch multiple applications (tasks) in separate terminal windows, simulating:

- Process management  
- Memory allocation  
- Inter-process communication (IPC)

Each application runs as a separate process using `fork()` and `exec()`. Tasks communicate with the system for resource requests (RAM, HDD) via IPC. A GTK-based desktop interface acts as the main control panel.
